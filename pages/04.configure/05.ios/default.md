The only way to use CarrotProxy on iOS devices is changing DNS servers for WI-FI connection. 

Please note that CarrotProxy will not work on Cellular Data with this configuration

**Configuration Guide**

Enter the Settings app on your iOS device, and select Wi-Fi. Tap the small "i" icon next to the name of the network that needs the DNS server details changed, scroll down, and tap Configure DNS.

At the top, change the setting from Automatic to Manual. In the section below, tap the red minus circle next to the DNS servers followed by Delete to remove them.

Tap Add Server, then in the new empty listing, type in the IP address of nearest CarrotProxy DNS server. You can check available servers, their IP address (make sure you are logged in) and test latency at [https://www.carrotproxy.com/servers](https://www.carrotproxy.com/servers)

Once finished, tap Save in the top-right corner.

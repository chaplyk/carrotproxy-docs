There are various reasons why previous guide may not work for you such as:
1. you are using IPv6
2. you can use only DCHP configuration
3. your AndroidTV version does not have this menu

In that case you can use _DNS Changer - Lilly_ application to change your DNS servers.

Note that app is not available in Play Market for TV so you have to sideload it.
